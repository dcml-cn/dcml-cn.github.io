<br>
My research activities center around medical image analysis through signal processing, machine learning, and computer vision techniques. 
Since 2018 I have been the holder of the MILCOM Chair. MILCOM aims to design machine-learning methods that explicitly consider the challenges of medical imaging data such as dealing with large volumes,  multi-modal and heterogenous data,  small and imbalanced databases, and/or limited access to expert annotations. 

### Survival Analysis, PET images and Machine Learning 

<img src="images/petsurv.png"/>

This project points to the development of machine learning algorithms to assist the diagnosis and personalized treatment of patients suffering from hematological diseases such as multiple myeloma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. In particular, we aim to *predict a patient's prognosis or treatment response given their full-body PET images*, possibly combined with clinical data. To this end, we have proposed several types of approaches: 

[Graph Neural Networks for survival analysis](/projects/petsurv/#graph-neural-networks-for-survival-analysis)

[Deep Learning and self-supervised learning ](/projects/petsurv)

[Random Survival Forests Framework](/projects/petsurv)

These works are done in close collaboration  with the Nuclear Medicine department of the CHU Nantes and the INSERM CRCINA team 2. They also contribute to the SIRIC ILIAD.
