The following projects have been supported in part by the European Regional Development
Fund (FEDER), the Pays de la Loire region on the Connect Talent scheme and Nantes MÃ©tropole (Convention 2017-10470).

### Survival Analysis, PET images and Machine Learning 

<img src="images/petsurv.png"/>

This project points to the development of machine learning algorithms to assist the diagnosis and personalized treatment of patients suffering from hematological diseases such as multiple myeloma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. In particular, we aim to *predict a patient's prognosis or treatment response given their full-body PET images*, possibly combined with clinical data. To this end, we have proposed several types of approaches: 

[Graph Neural Networks for survival analysis](/projects/petsurv.md#graph-neural-networks-for-survival-analysis)

[Deep Learning and self-supervised learning ](/projects/petsurv.md#deep-learning-and-self-supervised-learning)

[Random Survival Forests Framework](/projects/petsurv.md#random-survival-forests-framework)

These works are done in close collaboration  with the Nuclear Medicine department of the CHU Nantes and the INSERM CRCINA team 2. They also contribute to the SIRIC ILIAD.
