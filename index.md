### Survival Analysis, PET images and Learning 

[Graph-based survival learning](/sample_page)
<br></br>
We propose multi-lesion graphs as an original solution to caracterise full-body PET images of large-B-cell diffuse lymphoma patients, instead of single lesion or full image approaches, graphs explicitely model the varibilities in size and number of lesions. Relying on a Graph-Attention-Network (GAT) on top of the multi-lesion attributed graph, and based on a prospective dataset of more than 500 patients, we provide results for the
