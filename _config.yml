  Since 2018 I have been the holder of the MILCOM Chair. MILCOM aims to design machine-learning methods that explicitly consider the challenges of analysing medical images such as dealing with volumetric multi-modal and heterogenous data,  small and imbalanced databases, and/or limited access to expert annotations.
