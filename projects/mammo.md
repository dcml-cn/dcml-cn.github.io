## Early Breast Detection from Images

This project points to the early breast cancer detection from mammographies. The challenges are the heterogeneous and incomplete nature of the annotations. The main contribution has been the proposition of a self-supervised approach to guide a convolutional neural network to detect and spatially locate anormalities while training with image-wise annotations only\footnote{\bibentry{tardy2021abnormalities}}. We have also explored two approaches to measure  the uncertainty of the predictions \footnote{\bibentry{tardy2019uncertainty}} and a multi-task method to learn from hetereogenous labels\footnote{\bibentry{tardy2022multitask}}. These are outcomes of Mickael Tardy's Ph.D.  

A second Ph.D., Guillaume Pelluet, follows this  fruitful industrial collaboration with the company Herami.  He has focused on the multi-scale nature of the problem\footnote{\bibentry{pelluet2021brainles}} and on further increasing the interpretability of the results through graph CNNs\footnote{\bibentry{pelluet2022miua}}.
